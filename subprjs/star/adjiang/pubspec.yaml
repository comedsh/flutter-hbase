# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # 将 infinite_scroll_pagination 的版本固定为 4.0.0 避免出现如下的错误；（背景：使用 infinite_scroll_pagination 4.1.0 出现如下错误）
  # RenderViewport does not support returning intrinsic dimensions.
  # Calculating the intrinsic dimensions would require instantiating every child of the viewport, which
  # defeats the point of viewports being lazy.
  # If you are merely trying to shrink-wrap the viewport in the main axis direction, consider a
  # RenderShrinkWrappingViewport render object (ShrinkWrappingViewport widget), which achieves that
  # effect without implementing the intrinsic dimension API.

  # The relevant error-causing widget was:

# flutter_native_splash 是在加载 flutter 之前填充 iOS 默认的白屏页面的
# 配置更改后执行 `dart run flutter_native_splash:create` 然后重新启动 app 即可；但是如果没有生效，则首先尝试 flutter clean and recompile your app，
# 如果还是不行，则需要首先删除 app、然后重启设备、然后重新安装并启动 app 即可修复
flutter_native_splash:
  # color: "#39075f"
  # 实测：会拉升 launcher_bg.png 以填充满整个屏幕，这样便弥补了 color 无法渐变的遗憾
